# Skifree.js

This is a **work in progress** JavaScript port of the popular 1991 PC game [SkiFree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skifree) by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/).

[**Play this right now if you want to**](http://neverson42.github.io/skipepe.js) (opens a demo page).

##
* Now with PEPES!!!!

## Features so far:

* Skiing down a never-ending skislope with randomly-generated trees which do not have transparent backgrounds
* Collision detection with trees - and the appropriate reaction
* Turning left and right
* Stopping
* MONSTAHS! GRAAAAHHH! They even eat you and then run away because they're full
* Distance tracking so you can see how far you've gone, you absolute badass
* Speed boost (this was a little-known feature to get away from monsters) using the F key
* **MOBILE SUPPORT** - This is cool - try loading the [**the demo page**](http://basicallydan.github.io/skifree.js) on a mobile device and then use your finger to direct the skier around the piste. Also try double-tap ;)
* Rainbow jump platforms & jumping - though a couple of improvements could be made
* LocalStorage high-score (thanks, [@ddoolin](https://github.com/ddoolin)!)
* Custom-sized Hitboxes
* Big trees & crashing into them both whilst skiing and jumping

## So, what's left to do?

This is what I'm gonna do, probably in this order. Who the hell knows. There are other features to the original game but I'm not going to add them to the list until I've gotten through this one.

* Rocks
* Snowboarders
* Dogs
* Ski Lifts

Some features which weren't in the original which I'd like to give a go:

* Being a snowboarder instead of a boring old skier
* Tricks, or something?
* Multiplayer (ooooo wouldn't that be fun?!)

## F*ck this, let me play the game goddammit

* Open up index.html in Chrome, or maybe even Firefox - I haven't tested it in anything but Chrome and Mobile Safari yet, and I probably won't I'm afraid
* Go.

## I like to run Unit tests before I do ANYTHING.

* Right, well first you need to do an `npm install`
* Run `mocha` and you should see some beautiful passing tests

## This is pretty frickin' sweet but it's clearly not finished. I can totally improve it. Let me improve it, dammit.

* We are #seekingcontributors

If you'd like an easy way to see how the game works, you can play the original in an Emulator: https://archive.org/details/win3_WINSKI
